As you can see, this plugin patches ChatListEntry.createEmbedEntries();
createEmbedEntries handles what embeds to display below a message, it's the function that sets up an array ChatListEntry which then gets rendered.
If you patch this function you can even make your own custom embeds and put them below the message.

createEmbedEntries is obfsucated, but if you dig deep enough you can find the deobfuscated parameters:

public final List<ChatListEntry> createEmbedEntries(
	Message message,
	StoreMessageState.State state,
	boolean isBlockedExpanded,
	boolean allowAnimatedEmojis,
	boolean autoPlayGifs,
	boolean z5, //The name of this one is a mystery, but if it's true an empty ChatListEntry is returned.
	long guildID,
	boolean isThreadStarter
);

Since twitter embeds are just a regular embed it's likely there's a flag that controls whether or not they should be generated, but the decompilation failed at some parts so it's a mystery.
