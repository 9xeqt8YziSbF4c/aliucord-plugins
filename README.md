Cool Aliucord plugins

## [Copy Instead Of Share Images](https://github.com/RhythmLunatic/aliucord-plugins/raw/builds/CopyInsteadOfShareImages.zip)
Replaces the share button in the image/video preview with one that only copies the URL to the clipboard.

## [MediaPickerPatcher](https://github.com/RhythmLunatic/aliucord-plugins/raw/builds/MediaPickerPatcher.zip)
Replaces the document picker with one that opens the default gallery app. Can also long press the button for original behavior.

Also allows picking videos from the gallery if your default app parses intents properly.

(This is actually a bit of a misnomer, Discord has a class named MediaPicker that is used for guilds and profile pictures but it doesn't patch that)
